History:
the KIMS was the first local and web multi scan of the world which
last version came out on 2006 programed by Thor. In 2009 it began
being developed to the new version by hands of DSR!

description:
Its function is to scan 1 or more files with many AVs and also administer
and updtae from the same GUI.
This Program does not leave any AV in you PC or at least that's the idea,
but not all AV allow scanning without their services (AVG for example).

how it works:
first you have to download the console version (preferably) of the AVs that
you want to use, for that click on the button download and follow the instructions
step by step, be carefull with with the ones that require intervention to install
once downloaded, don't scan anything yet, update the AVs.
